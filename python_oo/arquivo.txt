Meta-analysis is a central method for quality evidence generation.
In particular, meta-analysis is gaining speedy momentum in the growing world of quantitative information.
There are several software applications to process and output expected results.
Open-source software applications generating such results are receiving more attention.
This paper uses Python’s capabilities to provide applicable instruction to perform a meta-analysis.
